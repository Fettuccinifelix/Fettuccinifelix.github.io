        <h2>Background and Overview</h2>
        <p>As part of the UBC Bionics Design Team, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of embedded systems for our bionic prosthetic arm. 
        My focus was on EMG signal collection, processing, and integration into the main control architecture. This work involved reworking the EMG pipeline, transitioning away from a Python-based approach, 
        and ensuring everything could run efficiently on embedded hardware such as the Raspberry Pi Pico. The following sections outline the objectives, methods, and results of these embedded projects.</p>

        <h2>1.0 Project Objectives</h2>
        <p>The primary aims of this work were to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rework the EMG collection and processing pipeline into the Rust-based control application.</li>
          <li>Develop more robust signal cleaning and thresholding to handle noise and artifacts.</li>
          <li>Redesign the control module architecture to eliminate reliance on Python and run fully on a Rust-based systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2.0 Methodology</h2>
        <h3>2.1 EMG Collection and Processing Pipeline</h3>
        <p>Initially, EMG signals were collected and thresholded using a separate Python application. 
        This approach provided only basic detection of "grip" signals and was highly susceptible to noise. 
        To improve robustness, I integrated EMG data collection and processing directly into our Rust-based control program (GPM). 
        This included implementing filtering, thresholding logic, and safeguards against signal artifacts caused by motion or electrode noise.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Control Module Update</h3>
        <p>The original control architecture used an event-driven Rust engine (GPM) that relied on a Python module to interpret EMG signals. 
        While effective on a Raspberry Pi 4, this structure was unsuitable for our next design goal which was miniaturization onto a Raspberry Pi Pico embedded board. 
        To address this, I refactored the architecture so GPM directly collected and processed EMG signals without external dependencies. 
        This streamlined the system, reduced computational overhead, and made it feasible to embed all electronics within the prosthetic arm.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For context, initially the team had planned to include an entire computer vision system which would run off of the Python module, as well as some form of machine learning model to analyze EMG data. 
            However, we found that when trying to run the both the GPM and analytics module on the Pi Pico, the program would lag and the arm's performance would tank, so we made the change to get rid of the analytics module as a whole to reduce overhead and improve performance.</p>

        <h2>3.0 Results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Improved Signal Processing:</em> Thresholding and filtering reduced false activations caused by noise and motion artifacts.</li>
          <li><em>Embedded Integration:</em> Eliminating the Python module allowed the system to run fully on the Pi Pico.</li>
          <li><em>Control Reliability:</em> Event-driven architecture ensured smooth task delegation and improved response times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4.0 Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By restructuring the EMG pipeline and control module architecture, the system became more efficient, resilient, and fully embedded. 
        These improvements advance the UBC Bionics project by enabling a more compact and robust control system for the prosthetic arm.</p>
