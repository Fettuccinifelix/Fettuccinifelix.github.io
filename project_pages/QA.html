      <h2>Background & Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project, completed during my research term at BC Cancer, focuses on developing a 
        <strong>quality assurance (QA) tool</strong> for evaluating <strong>internal mammary lymph node (IMN)</strong> 
        contours generated by <em>Limbus Contour</em>, a deep learning-based auto-segmentation software. 
        The tool supports a retrospective cohort of approximately 19,000 breast cancer patients (2005–2014) 
        and aims to improve dosimetric studies linking IMN dose, tumor location, and survival outcomes.

      <h2>1.0 Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a QA pipeline to assess fidelity of AI-generated IMN contours.</li>
        <li>Establish a reliable ground-truth set for evaluation.</li>
        <li>Support retrospective research into the effects of IMN irradiation on survival outcomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2.0 Methodology</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        In-house scripts were written in <strong>C#</strong> using the <strong>Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI)</strong> 
        to analyze contour quality. The QA tool flagged patients with contours outside of statistically defined ranges 
        (median ± 2SD, Min/Max, IQR) or with structural faults such as missing slices.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Evaluation Approaches</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Method A:</strong> Compared AI contours against clinical contours. This was unreliable due to inconsistent guidelines (RTOG vs ESTRO) and incomplete slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Method B:</strong> Compared AI contours to a reviewed subset of 100 Limbus-generated contours (RTOG guideline), providing a consistent baseline.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        During contour transfer, ESAPI’s <code>Structure.SegmentVolume()</code> occasionally shifted contours 
        in cases where CT dimensions varied due to couch insertions. This was resolved by directly copying coordinates 
        slice-by-slice. Ratios such as IMN:Lung and IMN:Chest Wall were introduced to normalize contour dimensions 
        across patients of varying sizes.
      </p>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>3.0 Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Method A flagged <strong>3/100</strong> contours.</li>
        <li>Method B flagged <strong>32/100</strong> contours.</li>
        <li>Clinician review flagged <strong>47/100</strong>, with Z-dimension errors as the most common fault.</li>
        <li>The QA tool misidentified ~25% of cases, depending on thresholds and metrics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>4.0 Findings & Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        Clinical contours were too inconsistent to serve as a reliable ground-truth. The reviewed subset of 
        Limbus contours was more effective for QA. The most common failure mode was incorrect Z-dimension contouring. 
        Absolute length metrics introduced patient-size bias, making normalized ratios a better approach.
      </p>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>5.0 Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand the dataset used for defining clinically acceptable ranges.</li>
        <li>Incorporate anatomical context (e.g., relative placement to chest wall or lungs).</li>
        <li>Integrate QA directly into the pipeline for real-time flagging of errors.</li>
        <li>Validate the tool across larger and independent patient cohorts.</li>
      </ul>
