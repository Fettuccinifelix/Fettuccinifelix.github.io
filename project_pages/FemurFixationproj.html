      <h2>Background & Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our team developed a fracture fixation plate aimed at elderly women with femoral fractures, a group highly susceptible to osteoporosis-related complications. These patients require implants that allow immediate weight-bearing and minimize the risk of bending under load, while also supporting natural bone healing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Current fixation plates often fail to meet these needs, especially in elderly patients with reduced bone density. Collaborating with Dr. Pierre Guy, we designed a fracture fixation plate solution focused on stability, biocompatibility, and long-term durability.

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>1.0 Needs Assessment and Requirements</h2>
      <p>We identified and prioritized critical design requirements to ensure the implant met specific clinical needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Full Weight-Bearing Support:</em> Enables patients to bear weight on the affected limb early in recovery.</li>
        <li><em>Minimally Invasive Procedure:</em> Designed for reduced bleeding and anesthesia time, addressing age-related frailty.</li>
        <li><em>Compact and Lightweight:</em> Fits comfortably alongside the femur with minimal interference.</li>
        <li><em>Biocompatibility:</em> Made of materials resistant to rejection and degradation within the body.</li>
        <li><em>Cost Efficiency:</em> Reduces healthcare costs by minimizing replacements or follow-up surgeries.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>2.0 Concept Development</h2>
      <p>Our team generated and evaluated multiple design concepts, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Rod-Plate Combination:</em> An intramedullary rod paired with a small lateral locking plate to improve stability.</li>
        <li><em>Two Plates in Conjunction:</em> Plates applied to the lateral and medial sides of the femur for balanced support.</li>
        <li><em>Updated Intramedullary Nail:</em> A threaded rod design to enhance fixation and stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After brainstorming and consulting with clinical experts, we selected the <em>Two Plates in Conjunction</em> design for its optimal stability and weight-bearing capabilities.
      </p>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>3.0 System Specifications and Final Design</h2>
      <p>The final design, modeled in SolidWorks, comprises:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Titanium Alloy Plates:</em> High strength and biocompatibility for long-term stability.</li>
        <li><em>Lateral and Medial Plate Configuration:</em> Reduces bending under load by distributing weight evenly across the femur.</li>
        <li><em>Minimized Contact Area:</em> Maintains blood flow and reduces stress shielding, supporting natural bone healing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Surgical Procedure</h3>
      <p>
        Our design supports a Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) surgical approach, simplifying plate insertion through smaller incisions to promote faster recovery and reduced surgical risk.

      <h2>4.0 Future Work and Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Future steps include prototyping with titanium alloy models, testing under simulated loading conditions, and refining bone models to improve accuracy for elderly patients. Further cadaver or advanced model testing will validate the design’s effectiveness across fracture types and patient anatomies.
