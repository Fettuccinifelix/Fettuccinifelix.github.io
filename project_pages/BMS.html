      <h2>Background & Overview</h2>
      <p>
        UBC Bionics is an undergraduate design team focused on developing innovative solutions to enhance or replace human physiological functions. The team is working on GRASP, a myoelectric prosthetic arm, and NERV, a brain-computer interface. The BMS for GRASP protects the battery from faults, optimizes health, and safeguards electronics.

      <h2>3.0 Initial Iteration</h2>
      <p>Version 1 of the Battery Management System (BMS) involves the use of a Master-Slave topology to connect the batteries to the rest of the GRASP system. Version 1 of the BMS uses 2 boards, the first of which is the master board mounted inside the forearm compartment. The master board contains an STM32 microcontroller to communicate with our slave board, as well as several buck converters to step down the pack voltage to an acceptable level for each electrical subsystem within GRASP. My partner Justin worked on this board. </p>
  
    <p>The other board used for this BMS is the slave board, mounted in a shoulder housing. The main features of the slave board include over fault protection (ex: overcharge, overdischarge), charge balancing, and fuel gauging (State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) tracking). These features are carried out by a BQ7791502 battery protection IC as well as a BQ34110 fuel gauge IC both from Texas Instruments. I worked on this board, and most of this page will be discussing the details around it</p>

      <h3>Battery Protection (BQ77915)</h3>
      <p>The battery protection feature of this BMS stems from the use of a BQ7791502 protection IC to prevent the batteries from various over faults. 
      </p>

      <p>The BQ77915 is a low-power battery management system (BMS) IC designed to provide a comprehensive suite of voltage, current, temperature protections and smart cell balancing for battery packs without the use of a microcontroller. The BQ77915 IC provides pack protection through integrated CHG and DSG low-side NMOS FET drivers. The IC is also capable of providing passive cell balancing through integrated FETs for cell balancing currents up to 50 mA. Specifically, the BQ77915 protects against the following: overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent charge, overcurrent discharge, short circuit discharge, and over/under-temperature while charging and discharging.

      <h3>Fuel Gauging (BQ34110)</h3>
      <p>The Slave Board of the BMS is responsible for tracking both the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH), primarily through the integrated BQ34110 battery gas gauge. This gauge communicates with the Master Board via the I2C protocol.
      </p>

      <p>The BQ34110 gas gauge leverages Compensated End-of-Discharge Voltage (CEDV) technology to accurately predict battery capacity and performance metrics. It can be queried by a host processor to provide critical cell data, including remaining capacity, full charge capacity, and average current. To monitor battery health, the device's End of Service feature conducts periodic Learning Phases, which involve a controlled discharge of around 1% capacity, alerting the system when the battery nears the end of its usable service life.
      </p>

      <p>Battery current is measured by monitoring the voltage across a series resistor, which is placed in line with the battery pack. This resistor creates a small voltage drop proportional to the current flowing through it. The BQ34110 integrates two ADCs: one dedicated to current measurement and the other for additional parameters such as temperature and voltage. By detecting this voltage drop, the BQ34110 accurately calculates the current flowing into or out of the battery, providing essential data for estimating the State of Charge (SOC). SOC estimation is critical for determining the battery's remaining capacity, as it depends on the cumulative charge or discharge over time.
      </p>

      <p>Communication with the BQ34110 is handled via an I2C interface, through which commands read from and write to the device’s control registers and data flash memory. Cell data is stored in non-volatile flash memory, and accessing specific data requires knowledge of the relevant data flash subclass and offset. Additionally, the BQ34110 provides 32 bytes of user-programmable data flash memory for customizable data storage.

      <h3>3.1 Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        During testing, I realized I had mistakenly shorted the CHG and DSG MOSFETs through ground planes. To resolve this, I redesigned the system into two separate PCBs and had multiple peer reviews before fabricating. If time permitted, I would re-merge the circuits into one board, incorporate a programmable IC for configurable thresholds, and ideally integrate protection and fuel gauging into one IC to reduce footprint.
